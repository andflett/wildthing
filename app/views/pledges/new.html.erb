	<h1>The Wild Thing Pledge</h1>
	<p>Children today are getting dangerously tame. We need your help to change that and make them wild. In the UK we are raising the unhappiest children in the developed world. We give them plenty of food, millions of TV channels, the Internet and computer games. What is going on? What are they unhappy about?</p>
	<h2>The lure of the indoors is creating a generation that has no connection with nature</h2>
	<p>Stepping outside and connecting with nature is both a small step out of your door, and a wild leap into a new way of life. Children in the UK (aged 5 &ndash; 16) spend: 2.5 hours every day watching TV and 1.7 hours every day online.</p>
	<h2>That is over 4 hours screen time per day</h2>
	<p>Spending time outdoors is fun, good for you and free. Given the chance, children love being outdoors. They just need the chance.</p>
	<p>If we don't act, a generation of children will miss out on developing a proper connection with nature that will last for their whole life. As a species we will lose vital natural knowledge. We need children to be future custodians of the natural world.</p>
	<p>The Wild Thing Pledge is your promise to spend as much time outside every day as you do on screens. Match your screen time with wild time. And encourage your children to do the same.</p>
